Final project of Digital Systems Laboratory (3rd semester).

Implementation of PS2 keyboard and VGA drivers in Altera DE2 board. 

By connecting a PS2 keyboard to the FPGA, the user can write text that is then displayed on an external monitor via VGA. The user can change the letters and background color by using the switches in the FPGA.



I included the main source files but couldn't upload the whole (compiled) project due to Github restrictions.
